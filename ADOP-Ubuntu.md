### Step-1: Install docker engine.

   [Dokcer-Installation-Ubuntu](https://github.com/DevOpsBasicSetup/Phase-2/blob/master/Docker/DockerEngine/2.1.Dokcer-Installation-Ubuntu.md)

### Step-2: Install docker-compose.

  [Dokcer-compose-Installation-Ubuntu](https://github.com/DevOpsBasicSetup/Phase-2/blob/master/Docker/DockerCompose/Installation-and-example-1.md)

### Step-3: Install docker-machine.

  [Dokcer-Machine-Installation-Ubuntu](https://github.com/DevOpsBasicSetup/Phase-2/blob/master/Docker/DokcerMachine/Installation-and-example.md)

### Step-4: Install git & AWSCLI

apt-get update -y

apt-get install git -y

apt-get install python-pip -y

apt install awscli -y

git --version

pip --version

python --version

### Step-5: Setup ADOP

git clone https://github.com/Accenture/adop-docker-compose.git

cd adop-docker-compose

./quickstart.sh -t aws -m ADOP-DEVOPS -c vpc-02389d534cfa38107 -r us-east-2 -z a -u docker-m -p DevOps@123 -a AKIAJZPIKZWDDADDPCZA -s v6Cdz6DxbJ4SBBXUL6+2FiOHInbKgymbelRVZK+W

Internal execution process:

1. while getopts `t:m:a:s:c:z:r:u:p:h` opt;

2. if [ -z ${MACHINE_TYPE} ]; then

3. # Switch based on the machine type
     case ${MACHINE_TYPE} in 
	 
4. provision_aws

	Validating the parameters
	
	Create  file with parameters
	
	source_aws 
		# ./conf/provider/env.provider.aws.sh is updating with AWS VPC, keypair, instance name etc (the values which we passed)
		# Export the paramters as env variables
		
	Creating a docker host/machine.
	
		Preapting a docker machine command
		
		Running docker-machine command to create a docker host
	
	

5. Running the command on Dokcer mahine: ./adop compose -m "${MACHINE_NAME}" ${CLI_COMPOSE_OPTS} init

6. Running the command on Dokcer mahine: ./adop certbot gen-export-certs "registry.$(docker-machine ip ${MACHINE_NAME}).nip.io" registry

7. Launch the URL to access dashboard(enter the uname and pwd): http://[publicIp]/  ex: http://18.223.172.213/
OutPut:

root@ip-172-31-15-41:~/adop-docker-compose# ./quickstart.sh -t aws -m ADOP-DEVOP                                                                                                                S -c vpc-02389d534cfa38107 -r us-east-2 -z a -u docker-m -p DevOps@123 -a AKIAJZ                                                                                                                PIKZWDDADDPCZA -s v6Cdz6DxbJ4SBBXUL6+2FiOHInbKgymbelRVZK+W

* In using quickstart you are acknowledging this,   *
